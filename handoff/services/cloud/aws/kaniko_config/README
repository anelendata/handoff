The handoff container builder image,
public.ecr.aws/m5u3u5p2/handoff-container-builder

is just a pre-configured kaniko image as in this directory.

To build this image, do:

docker build -t handoff-container-builder .

Push the image to a public repository:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/getting-started-cli.html

This command prepares the tar.gz for kaniko and upload to S3, under the project subfolder "bundles":
handoff container bundle -p <project_dir>

Then this command builds the project's docker image as handoff task. Kaniko executes as a Fargate task, and upload the image to the image registry:
handoff cloud container build -p <project_dir>
