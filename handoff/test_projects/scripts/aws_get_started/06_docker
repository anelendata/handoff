Let's build a Docker image.

Try running the following command. Enter y when prompted at the beginning.
The build may take 5~10 minutes.
"

Command "handoff container build -p 04_install"

echo "
Now let's run the code in the Docker container.
"

Command "handoff container run -p 04_install --envs __VARS='start_date=$(date -I -d '-7 day')'"

Confirm the run by checking the logs. Also check the artifacts on S3:

echo "
Now that we know the Docker container runs fine, let's push it to
AWS Elastic Container Registry. This may take a few minutes.
"

Command "handoff container push -p 04_install"

REGION=`handoff -p 04_install envs get -v key=AWS_REGION -l critical`
echo "
Confirm that the Docker image has been uploaded to:

https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories?region=$REGION

Prompt

Thanks

echo "
Now that the Docker image is prepared, we will finally deploy the task on
AWS Fargate in the next tutorial.
